	test
- refactor all test logic

	design

	<ui>
- template: impelement as module
		<container>
- DRY refactor at add_element
		<element>
- map element attributes and actions to data model instance
- remove container functionality to container from parser
	- may be refactor to remove all other instances related functionality to intances themselves

	<log>
- add log module functionality:
	- per instance debug on\off
		- all model instances
		- one instance throw multiple modules

	<core>
		<task>
- async task handling, results, running - ended, multiple task creation
	- every task is closed only when subtasks finished, sync or async
		- this is to be rethinked...

- make task test result

	general
- two "model" constructors - element.js and model.js, refactor model logic
- Q: constructors are in tasks but no task error handled is available at them????
- split model model and instance model

- create core-model along with data-model to provide common for all core modules functionality
