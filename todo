	test
- refactor all test logic

	design
- create design documentation

	<ui>
- template: impelement as module
		<container>
- DRY refactor at add_element
		<element>
- remove container functionality to container from parser
	- may be refactor to remove all other instances related functionality to intances themselves

	<log>
- make logs on\off throw console interface
- raise alarms and clear it
	- for example, when element added to queue - raise alarm no container found, and then clear the alarm once element is in container

	<core>
		<task>
- async task handling, results, running - ended, multiple task creation
	- every task is closed only when subtasks finished, sync or async
		- this is to be rethinked...
- common debug storage instead of in-task storage
- task counter


	general
- two "model" constructors - element.js and model.js, refactor model logic
- Q: constructors are in tasks but no task error handled is available at them????
- split model model and instance model

- create core-model along with data-model to provide common for all core modules functionality
